Write a ____ short story of 4 paragraphe where the protagonist is ____ . This story is happening at ____. The main conflict of the story is ____. 

Write a funny banana short story of 4 paragraphe where the protagonist is an angry dying . This story is happening at a fire moutain. The main conflict of the story is eye frog.

> Once upon a sizzling afternoon, in the heart of the Fire Mountain, there lived a banana named Barry who was not only ripe but also excessively angry. Barry was furious because he had been peeled by an overenthusiastic monkey who didn't appreciate the value of personal space. Now, basking in the molten glow of the lava, Barry's anger intensified as he felt his life slipping away – or rather, slipping down his banana peel.
As Barry raged against the injustice of being prematurely peeled, he noticed a peculiar creature hopping towards him. This was no ordinary frog; it was an eye frog, known for its uncanny ability to stare at things with its big, unblinking eyes. The eye frog stared at Barry with an intensity that made the volcanic surroundings seem downright tepid.
Barry, already enraged, couldn't tolerate the unblinking gaze of the eye frog. In a fit of banana fury, he wiggled and jiggled, trying to escape the relentless scrutiny. However, the eye frog was undeterred, maintaining its unbroken eye contact as if it had never seen a raging banana in a fiery mountain before.
The standoff between Barry and the eye frog continued, creating a spectacle that even the lava bubbling nearby found amusing. Despite the dire circumstances of Barry's imminent demise, the absurdity of the eye frog's unwavering gaze managed to inject a dash of humor into the volcanic turmoil. And so, in the midst of a hot-headed banana's final moments, laughter echoed through the Fire Mountain, all thanks to an eye frog with an insatiable curiosity.

I think the best choice is the Thicker sanded plexi I like the way it diffuses partialy the light.
I won't have the MDF anmore just the thicker plexi and we would see the electronics like a gameboy color.
